Consumer Complaint Analytics with Python
========================================

This project explores consumer complaint data from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) using Python. The goal is to uncover meaningful trends, identify high-severity issues, and evaluate customer impact through effective data visualization and analysis.

Project Objectives
------------------
- Clean and preprocess the dataset (handle missing values, date formats, and duplicates)
- Visualize complaint distribution by U.S. states using bar and pie charts
- Identify the most frequent complaint issues and their impact
- Build a custom Complaint Severity Index based on response type and timeliness
- Analyze complaint trends over time for top products
- Develop a Customer Impact Score using complaint frequency and resolution weight
- Perform additional EDA including response time trends, outliers, and distribution

Files Included
--------------
- python project1.py – Main Python script with all analysis functions and visualizations
- Consumer Complaints.csv – Dataset used for analysis
- README.md – Project documentation

Technologies Used
-----------------
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

How to Run the Project

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required libraries:
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
3. Place the following files in the same folder:
   - python project1.py
   - Consumer Complaints.csv
4. Run the script:

Key Insights
------------
- Top 10 complaint issues identified
- Certain states report disproportionately high complaint volumes
- Some products show higher severity scores and need targeted attention
- Time-series analysis reveals seasonal complaint spikes
- Response times vary with detectable outliers
